description: Ground ML architecture reasoning in Lean mathlib evidence. Use when the task involves ML architecture proposals, invariants, probabilistic semantics, linear algebra correctness, numerical stability, optimizer-side reasoning, or any mathematical claim that should be separated into formal support, engineering inference, and empirical gaps.

# Mathlib-Backed ML Architecture

Use this skill to keep formal math, architecture judgment, and empirical claims separate.

## Workflow

1. Classify every requested claim as one of:
   - formally checkable in Lean/mathlib
   - engineering inference built on formal facts
   - empirical or product/system constraint
2. Read `references/architecture_contract.md` first.
3. Read `references/mathlib_scope.md` when you need theorem families, search patterns, or local setup reminders.
4. If the local Lean setup is unclear, inspect it first:

```bash
python "<resolved-skill-dir>/scripts/doctor.py"
```

5. If `proofs/` is missing and the workspace should support formal checks, bootstrap it before searching:

```bash
python "<resolved-skill-dir>/scripts/bootstrap_proofs.py"
```

If bootstrap is not possible in the current workspace, say that formal verification is unavailable here.

6. Search local evidence before making formal claims:

```bash
python "<resolved-skill-dir>/scripts/search_mathlib.py" "<query>"
```

Use `--json` when you want machine-readable theorem candidates with names, import paths, and locations.

7. Validate candidate theorems in `proofs/ProofScratch.lean` before citing them as formal support:

```bash
python "<resolved-skill-dir>/scripts/lean_check.py"
```

The result counts as verified only when `lean_check.py` succeeds. If it falls back from `lake env lean` to direct `lean` with `LEAN_PATH`, record that verification method explicitly.

8. Write the response in this order:
   - Proposed architecture
   - Formal evidence from mathlib
   - Engineering inference built on top of formal facts
   - Gaps requiring benchmarks or papers
   - Risks

9. For nontrivial requests, emit the artifact bundle defined in `references/architecture_contract.md`:
   - `report.md`
   - `evidence.json`
   - `session_log.json` when bootstrap or verification diagnostics matter

   Keep the bundle consistent with the written response.

## Hard Rules

- Never call a heuristic "proved".
- If no supporting theorem is found or verified, write `No direct formal support found in mathlib.`
- If a theorem only proves a local property, state the exact boundary.
- If Lean tooling is missing or `lean_check.py` does not succeed, treat the result as unverified.
- If the workspace has no `proofs/` directory, say that formal verification was unavailable because the local Lean project is missing or bootstrap was not run. Do not attribute that case to theorem failure.
- If fallback verification was used, record the exact verification method rather than implying the official `lake env lean` path succeeded.
- For nontrivial requests, treat the artifact bundle as required rather than optional.

## Evidence Record

For each cited theorem or definition, record:

- theorem or definition name
- import path
- faithful plain-language meaning
- exact architectural subclaim it supports
- exact boundary it does not support

## Local Resources

- `references/architecture_contract.md`: required output contract and claim-labeling rules.
- `references/mathlib_scope.md`: boundaries of what mathlib can and cannot support, plus query ideas and local setup notes.
- `scripts/doctor.py`: inspect the local Lean/mathlib environment and emit agent-friendly diagnostics.
- `scripts/bootstrap_proofs.py`: create `proofs/`, initialize mathlib, fetch cache when needed, and run a smoke verification pass.
- `scripts/search_mathlib.py`: search the current repo's `proofs/` project and any downloaded mathlib checkout for ranked theorem candidates.
- `scripts/lean_check.py`: verify `proofs/ProofScratch.lean` via `lake env lean`, with direct `lean` fallback when the official path is unavailable.
