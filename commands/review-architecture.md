# /review-architecture

Audit an ML architecture with the `mathlib-ml-arch` discipline.

## Canonical Entry Point

The public CLI surface for this plugin lives in root `scripts/`.

Happy-path demo:

`python scripts/review_architecture.py --demo --output-dir reports/mathlib_ml_arch_demo`

## Inputs

- `architecture_notes`: the architecture, code paths, or design description to audit
- `focus`: optional area to emphasize, such as routing, memory, optimization, or geometry

## Workflow

1. Inventory the important internal variables, modules, and state.
2. Assign entity signatures and typed interfaces where the design mixes roles.
3. Run `python scripts/doctor.py` when the local Lean setup is uncertain.
4. If `doctor.py` reports that `lake` / `lean` are unavailable, run `python scripts/bootstrap_toolchain.py` so the plugin can use a cache-local Lean toolchain.
5. If the shared proofs workspace is missing and formal checks should be possible, run `python scripts/setup_plugin.py --target search` first. Use `python scripts/setup_plugin.py --target verify --yes` only when the review really needs full Lean verification artifacts.
6. Search for shared mathlib evidence before claiming formal support.
7. Verify candidate theorems with `python scripts/lean_check.py`, and record the exact verification method if fallback verification was used.
8. Separate each claim into formal support, engineering inference, or empirical gap.
9. Emit the artifact bundle required by the skill contract.
10. Validate the bundle explicitly with `python scripts/validate_artifact_bundle.py --bundle-dir <dir>`.
11. When the audit depends on one explicit scalar formula, prefer the EML helpers first:
    - `python scripts/eml_normalize.py --formula "<expr>"`
    - `python scripts/eml_verify.py --formula "<expr>"`
    - `python scripts/boundary_classify.py --formula "<expr>"`

## Output Contract

- Proposed architecture
- Formal evidence from mathlib
- Engineering inference built on top of formal facts
- Gaps requiring benchmarks or papers
- Risks

The default artifact location should be `reports/` next to the workspace root or
plugin root. Sample/demo artifacts belong in `fixtures/review-architecture/`.
Add `session_log.json` when bootstrap or verification diagnostics are part of
the audit trail.

If theorem search or witness coverage comes up empty, state:

`No direct formal support found in mathlib.`

If Lean verification was unavailable or not run, state that formal support from
Lean/mathlib was not obtained in this environment instead of presenting that
case as negative theorem evidence.

If the shared proofs workspace does not exist yet, state that no usable shared
Lean project is available instead of attributing the failure to `lake`, `git`,
or theorem search.
